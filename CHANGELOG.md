## 1.0.0

Released: `<YYYY-MM-DD>`

### New

* Initial stable release.

### Added

* Added following contracts:
    - `Laravie\Codex\Contracts\Client`.
    - `Laravie\Codex\Contracts\Request`.
    - `Laravie\Codex\Contracts\Response`.
    - `Laravie\Codex\Contracts\Sanitizer`.
* Added `Laravie\Codex\Discovery::make()` helper method to build HTTP Client.
* Added `Laravie\Codex\Discovery::flush()` helper method to flush cached HTTP Client.
* Added `getBody()`, `getContent()` and `getStatusCode()` method to `Laravie\Codex\Response`, which is also part of `Response` contract.
* Added `sanitizeFrom()` and `sanitizeTo()` to `Laravie\Codex\Support\WithSanitizer` trait.

### Changes

* Move declaration `sanitizeWith()` from `Laravie\Codex\Client` to `Request` class, ignore this if sanitization isn't needed.
* `Laravie\Codex\Request` should set sanitizer to `Laravie\Codex\Response` before running `Response::validate()` method.
